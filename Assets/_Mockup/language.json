    "intro_0_1": "In this game, you will be helping these fine capable frogs analyze a potentially habitable planet by identifying the shapes scattered across the land.",
    "intro_0_2": "When it comes to categorizing shapes, one must figure out the common attributes they share.",
    "intro_1_0": "Here are some primary categories and their attributes that differentiate them from each other.",
    "intro_1_1": "For now, we will be focusing on identifying polygons.",
    "intro_2_0": "Remember that a polygon is formed by three or more straight lines that are connected in a loop.",
    "intro_3_0": "Now let's go forth, and help these lads survey the land!",
    "level_intro_0_0": "The following types of shapes will come up. Be sure to remember them!",
    "level_0_continue": "Go ahead and collect the rest of the shapes! Remember to match them with the correct category.",
    "level_intro_3_0": "Now that we've covered some of the polygons, let's take a closer look at triangles.",
    "level_intro_3_1": "As a sub-category of polygons, triangles follow the same attribute of being formed by a number of straight lines connected in a loop. In this case, there are three.",
    "level_intro_3_2": "With that in mind, we can then further identify sub-categories under the triangle with additional attributes.",
    "level_intro_3_3": "For this level, we will be looking at different triangles based on their angle values. Be sure to remember them!",
    "level_intro_4_0": "Now that we've seen some triangles based on their angle values, let's take a look at the ones based on their side values.",
    "level_intro_5_0": "For this level, we will be categorizing triangles based on their angles, and side lengths. These triangles will have more than one category that fit their attributes.",
    "level_intro_6_0": "We'll now be looking at the next sub-category of polygons, the quadrilaterals.",
    "level_intro_6_1": "As the name suggests, it is four-sided.",
    "level_intro_6_2": "We'll be looking at three particular quadrilaterals that have two pairs of opposite sides that are parallel, and equal-length.",
    "level_intro_6_3": "Just like triangles, some quadrilaterals have more than one matching category. Keep that in mind!",
    "level_intro_7_0": "On this level, we'll be looking at some more interesting quadrilaterals. These ones have emphasis on opposite sides and angles.",
    "level_intro_8_0": "On this final level, many of the quads will match with a bunch of categories.",
    "level_intro_8_1": "One helpful tip is to look at these categories in a hierarchy. Going from top to bottom, each level shares attributes from everything above.",
    "level_intro_8_2": "For example, a square is also: a rectangle, a rhombus, a parallelogram, a trapezoid, and a kite.",
    "level_intro_8_3": "Now on to reviewing these categories once more!",
    "end_0": "Congratulations!\nYou have successfully helped the spacefaring frogs survey the planet!\nBased on the analysis of the shapes gathered, the planet is habitable!\n\nThank you for playing!",
