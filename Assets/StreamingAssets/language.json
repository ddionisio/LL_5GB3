    "level_0_intro_0_2": "You can drag the view around to get a better look at the map.",
    "level_0_intro_0_3": "These buttons will allow you to rotate or elevate the view.",
    "level_0_intro_1_1": "The information on the upper-left tells you the measurement of the unit cube.",
    "level_0_intro_1_2": "Remember that the volume of an object tells us how much it occupies space.",
    "level_0_intro_1_3": "By using unit cubes, we can easily determine where to place the materials, and how much volume we will need.",
    "level_0_intro_1_4": "A unit cube's measurement can also be changed based on specific needs. In our case, one unit cube equals to one cubic feet.",
    "level_0_intro_2_0": "Here's our first objective.",
    "level_0_intro_2_1": "You will be placing a number of unit cubes on the ground to match the required volume.",
    "level_0_end_1": "If you count the number of unit cubes placed on the ground, it tells you the volume of the object.",
    "level_0_end_2": "In this case, this object is made up of 16 unit cubes, where each cube's volume is 1 cubic feet. Therefore the volume of the object is 16 cubic feet.",
    "level_0_end_3": "Anyhow, it's time to build!",
    "level_1_intro_0_1": "For this objective, we will have to stack more than one layer of cubes.",
    "level_1_intro_0_2": "In order to increase the stack while expanding, simply highlight the top surface and drag upwards.",
    "level_2_intro_0_1": "On this level, the unit cube's sides are half a foot, which gives us a volume of one-eighth cubic feet.",
    "level_2_intro_0_2": "Since we are dealing with measuring the object's volume using unit cubes, first you need to count them up.",
    "level_2_intro_0_3": "Then simply multiply that count with the unit cube's volume to get the correct result.",
    "level_2_intro_0_4": "So for this level, we will need 8 unit cubes. Multiply 8 with one-eighth to give you 1 cubic foot, the volume we want.",
    "level_2_unit_formula": "2 Units x 2 Units x 2 Units = 8 Cubic Units",
    "level_2_unit_volume": "Cubic Unit Volume = 1/8 ft³",
    "level_2_unit_to_volume": "8 Cubic Units x 1/8 ft³ = 1 ft³",
    "level_4_intro_0_1": "On this level, you will need to place two groups of unit cubes to get the required amount of volume.",
    "level_4_intro_0_2": "Volumes can be added together in any shape or form, so long as they are in the same measurement.",
    "level_4_intro_0_3": "In order for volumes to be added together, make sure they are placed adjacently on any of the sides.",
    "level_6_intro_0_1": "On this level, one of the objectives have a restricted height.",
    "level_6_intro_0_2": "You won't be able to expand this particular material's height beyond the limit.",
